# SQL
In this project, we have downloaded the datasets provided, load them into a database, write and execute SQL queries to answer the problems provided.

This project involves 3 datasets for the city of Chicago obtained from the Chicago Data Portal and are as follows:

1. Chicago Socioeconomic Indicators
This dataset contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a hardship index ,by Chicago community area, for the years 2008 â€“ 2012.

2. Chicago Public Schools
This dataset shows all school level performance data used to create CPS School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year.

3. Chicago Crime Data
This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days.

Procedural Steps:
1. Review the datasets:
To become familiar with the datasets snapshots for the three datasets in .CSV format can be downloaded from the given links.

2. Load the datasets into a database:
Perform this step using the LOAD tool in the Db2 console. You will need to create 3 tables in the database, one for each dataset, named as follows, and then load the respective .CSV file into the table:
1. CENSUS_DATA
2. CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS
3. CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA

3. Write and execute queries
Perform this step in the Jupyter notebook provided in the previous section. Carefully read and understand each problem. Compose and execute the appropriate SQL queries to answer each of the problems.
